# Phase 3: Interaction Design

*Eric Schieber, Matthew Burns, Minh Nguyen*

# Executive Summary
For this phase, we have completed and published our functional interactive prototype for our app, and also created a protocol pdf that serves as the script and instructions that a moderator would follow to collect data.  While our prototype is a very high level perspective of what our fully developed app would look like, it conveys how someone would navigate our app to perform the tasks we set out to achieve.  A user will be able to set up a router, configure the password and SSID, decide the best location to set up a router, set up repeaters and extenders, as well as perform a speed test.  Our protocol pdf aims to gather previous user experience with wifi networks, as well as testing out the usability of our app from the perspective of someone who has never used it before.  We then take the results from this protocol template and enter it into an excel datasheet, to keep our responses organized and in one place.

# Explanations to Protocol Questions

## Background
Our background questions are aiming to figure out what kind of experience our subject has with setting up and maintaining a wifi network.  We would also like to see what kind of services they have reached out to for assistance, to see how we can change our app to be more user friendly, or have more options for individuals to get help.  Ideally, we would like to have a group of users evenly distributed among the experience scale (low experience, medium experience, high experience) for our data set.

## Task 1
Ideally, this should be the task that has the highest completion rate.  We feel as if initially setting up a wifi router is the part in which most individuals have trouble with, and our app's goal is to make this as seamless of an experience as possible.  The app is designed to take you step by step through the process to achieve this task, so the completion rate for this task would be a good reflection of just how user friendly and efficient our app is.

## Task 2
This task question will highlight how easy it is for a user to change internal settings of their router.  As this is something we believe most people won’t be doing too often, it’s another test as to how user friendly our app is to the everyday user.  This will also tell us if we need to reposition the layout of buttons on the page that shows information about a specific device, as the user shouldn’t have to search too hard to find this functionality within our app.

## Task 3
This task will be a great test of another feature of our app, the speed test.  While we do not think this is a feature that will get used as much as the others, we would still like it to be easily accessible to those who are interested in figuring out just how far their wifi coverage is.  The first test will deduce if the average user can find and fully utilize the functionality of the speed test.  After that we hope to find out if our setup process for wifi extenders / repeaters is as seamless as we want it to be.

## Wrap up
The wrap up section is a great chance for us to get helpful user feedback about the app.  We will hopefully find out information on how good our UI is, as well as how our app performed functionality wise.

# Overall Approach to The Study
Our approach to this study is mainly to see how many tasks our subjects completed.  Our app is supposed to be the one stop shop for all things home networking, so it's important to us that tasks such as setting up a router, changing the SSID and password, and setting up external devices to improve the performance of your network, are able to be completed by almost everyone who pics up the app.  It's also important to us how long the subjects take to perform each task.  This is why we aren't taking a think-aloud approach, and rather have the moderator jot down notes as the subject is attempting to complete the tasks.
