# Phase 3: Interaction Design

*Eric Schieber, Matthew Burns, Minh Nguyen*

# Executive Summary
For this phase, we have completed and published our functional interactive prototype for our app, and also created a protocol pdf that serves as the script and instructions that a moderator would follow to collect data.  While our prototype is a very high level perspective of what our fully developed app would look like, it conveys how someone would navigate our app to perform the tasks we set out to achieve.  A user will be able to set up a router, configure the password and SSID, decide the best location to set up a router, set up repeaters and extenders, as well as perform a speed test.  Our protocol pdf aims to gather previous user experience with wifi networks, as well as testing out the usability of our app from the perspective of someone who has never used it before.  We then take the results from this protocol template and enter it into an excel datasheet, to keep our responses organized and in one place.
