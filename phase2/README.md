# Phase 2: Interaction Design

*Eric Schieber, Matthew Burns, Minh Nguyen*

# Executive Summary: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We created a mobile application that allows the user to set up their routers, extenders, and repeaters for their home WiFi network. The user will start at a screen that contains a list of devices that they may have already set up. If they haven't set up any devices, the screen will blank. The user can then add a device by tapping the plus icon in the top right corner. From there, the user will be able to decide whether or not they would like to set up a router or a repeater/extender. Depending on which device they choose, the user will be guided along a set of instructions to succesfully set up their device. After setting up either device, the user will be brought to a speed test that will test the download/upload speed of their current network. After setting up their rother, extnder or repeater, the user will be congratulated and will be able to return to the home page.

| Home Page  | Device Selection |
| This page is where the user starts. The user will be able to set up and add a new device by tapping the plus sign in the top right corner. | This is where the user will be able to select which type of device they'd like to set up. If the user has already set up their router, they can set up routers and repeaters seperately. | This page will then provide the user with general tips as to where to place their router. |

| Settings Confirmation | Applying Settings | Finish Applying Settings |
| This is the confirmation page where it confirms with the user if the information they entered is correct before it is applied to the network router. | A visual animation to indicate the user that settings are being applied. It may take a while depending on the user's connection. | Once settings are applied, it will show the user that the initial setup is complete and may transfer the user to the next step in setting up their network. |

| Channel Adjustment Tip | Scanning Animation | List containing networks info |
| This screen will display a very helpful tip on optimizing their network for obtaining the best performance and speed from their network. | Visual animation to indicate the user that it is scanning surrounding networks in order to prepare for network performance tweak. | This screen will display the outcome of the scanning from previous screen. It will give the user the option to view the generated graph for better visualization of whats going on. |

| Visualization of networks | Adjusting channel | Applying Settings |
| This screen will show the results in a more visual form in order to give the user a better understanding of whats going on. In the graph, the x-axis represents channels available for networks, while y-axis being the signal strengths of networks. | The user will then be allowed to choose their desired channel for their network. They can choose based on the results that they got from the scanning. | Visual animation to indicate the user that it is applying the settings the user chose. |

| Analyzer Complete |
| This indicates that the user is finished optimizing their networks by choosing the best channel. |
## Extender/Repeater Set Up:

| Repeater/Extender Start | Repeater/Extender Instructions | Connecting Screen |
| After setting up their network, the user will be asked if they have any repeaters/extenders that they'd like to set up. If they select yes, then they will follow the set up process. If they select no, they will be taken automatically to the network speed test. | This screen provides instructions for the user to set up their repeater/extender. | This screen is an indicator that the app is trying to connect to the repeater/extender that the user is trying to set up. |

| Connection Complete | Speed Test | Congratulations Screen |
| This screen will notify the user that the connection to their repeater/extender was succesful. At this point, they will be able to assign a name to the extender/repeater that they set up. | This screen will allow the user to run a speed test on their network after setting up their router and their extenders/repeaters. | This screen will be shown once every setup is finally complete and is ready for consumer use. |

## If No Extenders/Repeaters:

| Router Placement | Device Selection |
| If the user does not have any extenders or repeaters to set up, it will skip the process and go straight into finalization, which is the speed test to test the connection if it is operating correctly. | This screen will be shown once every setup is finally complete and is ready for consumer use. |
