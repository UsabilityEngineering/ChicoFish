## Phase 2: Interaction Design

*Eric Schieber, Matthew Burns, Minh Nguyen*

## Executive Summary: 
This design is what we created, inspired by the common issues that most of our interviewees dealt with while growing their plants. We started with a sketch of the design. Most of our interviewees wanted something that would work camera-based, as they are used to taking pictures for their families. They would be most comfortable with using the mobile application this way. Through iterative design, we improved on the sketch. We made we were error-tolerant being observant of our audience. After this, we created a wireframe that contained all the menu options and basic design. We thought of how the interactions would go, and we settled with a prototype that was easily learnable.

| This page is where the user starts. The user will be able to set up and add a new device by tapping the plus sign in the top right corner. | This is where the user will be able to select which type of device they'd like to set up. If the user has already set up their router, they can set up routers and repeaters seperately. | This page will then provide the user with general tips as to where to place their router. |
