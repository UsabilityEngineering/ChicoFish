## Phase 2: Interaction Design

*Eric Schieber, Matthew Burns, Minh Nguyen*

## Executive Summary: 
This design is what we created, inspired by the common issues that most of our interviewees dealt with while growing their plants. We started with a sketch of the design. Most of our interviewees wanted something that would work camera-based, as they are used to taking pictures for their families. They would be most comfortable with using the mobile application this way. Through iterative design, we improved on the sketch. We made we were error-tolerant being observant of our audience. After this, we created a wireframe that contained all the menu options and basic design. We thought of how the interactions would go, and we settled with a prototype that was easily learnable.

## Wireframes:

| Home Page  | Device Selection | Router Placement|
| This page is where the user starts. The user will be able to set up and add a new device by tapping the plus sign in the top right corner. | This is where the user will be able to select which type of device they'd like to set up. If the user has already set up their router, they can set up routers and repeaters seperately. | This page will then provide the user with general tips as to where to place their router. |

| Plant Scan | Plant Scan Confirmation | Plant Scan Results |
| This is the heart of the program, and is inspired due to our interviewees mentioning they wish they weould quickly be able to check with the internet what the problem is, without knowing any names initially. This is where the user can take a picture of the plant they want to diagnose. We will use the phone's camera to scan the image, and use advanced algorithms to detect any patterns that resemble an illness of the plant. | This was recommended to be added during class critique, just in case the user made mistakes while taking a picture of their plant. This is where the user can confirm if this picture is how they would like it. They can rotate it or they can confirm it. | Here is where the results of the plant scan go. This will describe the illness that the plant may have, what can cause the issue, and some remedies for the plant. |

| Previous Scans | Previous Scan Selection | Common Illnesses | 
| Here is where we can see all the scans we have done before, just in case we need reference to them down the road. | This is what will show if we select an option from the previous scans menu. | This is inspired due to our interviewees all dealt with similar issues, and we thought we could aggregate this data here. Here is where we show common illnesses that the plant owners deal with commonly, in hopes that this can help a user quickly solve the issue from guides from here. |

| Common Illnesses Selection | Profile / Settings | 
| Here is what we view if we select one of the options in the common illnesses menu. | Here is where the user can change their account information just in case if they need to provide more security and whatnot. |
