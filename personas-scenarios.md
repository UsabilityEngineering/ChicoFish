# Personas

## Robert (A)

Robert is a military veteran in his late 70s who wants to connect with his old friends. Since COVID-19 pandemic, Robert must quarantine the majority of the time for the sake of health. He heard how some friends are connecting through Zoom and Facebook, but isn’t familiar with that because Robert rarely has experience with computers.

## Emily (B)

Emily is a college student that is a computer engineering major in her early 20’s who just transferred to her dream college with her friends. Since the college is far away from home, she had to find an apartment with her friends. Unfortunately the apartment does not come with the internet, therefore she had to set up a WiFi system for her and her friends who are housemates. Emily does have some experience with WiFi setups, but apparently the setup for the apartment was a little different.

# Scenarios

## (A) Robert the Boomer's journey to the internet

Robert reluctantly begins trying to set up his WiFi network, knowing that he is not technologically adept. Though he knows that he will struggle, he is willing to try in order to possibly reconnect with his buddies during these tough times. Robert opens the box, pulls out all of the materials, and sees that there is an instruction manual. The instruction manual advises that he go to the company website for the best assistance. Robert then goes to his home computer to access the company website. Robert’s computer hasn’t been updated since he bought it. He already isn’t technologically adept and buying a new computer isn’t gonna do much for him. Robert patiently waits while his slow and old computer boots up. The computer finally loads and now Robert can find the company webpage. After some time and some struggle to navigate his computer, Robert finally makes it to the company webpage that contains the necessary instructions. The time it took for Robert to navigate his computer has put him in a mood of frustration. Robert tries to follow the instructions but is struggling to understand what some of the terms mean. Becoming increasingly frustrated, Robert calls his ISP for assistance. After being greeted by an automated call, the voice tells Robert that the line is busy and he will be put on hold. The longer Robert is on hold, the closer he is to giving up.

## (B) Emily's great struggle on initial internet setup

Once Emily got most of her things moved into her new apartment, she took the modem/router combo she received through her ISP and plugged it into the wall. The lights turned on, and she navigated to the website displayed on the bottom of the router. She updated her username and password, and the software prompts her to make selection for a few other options. She reads the descriptions between 2.4 and 5gz bands, but doesn't quite understand why she shouldn’t use both, so she selects an option at random. She then enters a random name for her SSID and leaves the setup website. She then connects her phone to the wifi, but for some reason isn’t getting any internet connection. She waits a few minutes, and nothing changes. She unplugs the router, plugs it back in, and tries again, with unfortunately no change. Frustrated, she calls her local ISP to get assistance. She spends upwards of 30-45minutes weaving her way through all the automated call options, before she finally is able to speak with an actual person. It turns out that Emily forgot to call her ISP and tell them that she had moved in, so the internet to the unit hadn’t been activated yet. Finally, after Emily’s internet started working, she noticed that the connection was very weak in the common areas of the house. She purchased some wifi extenders from her ISP and attempted to set them up around her house, and while they did improve the connection a little bit, it wasn’t as much as she hoped (she didn’t set them in up a good orientation around the router). Frustrated with the experience, Emily calls it good.
